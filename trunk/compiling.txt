HOWTO compile the Unofficial Cataclysm UI Toolkit by Jamash (Kil'jaeden-US)

### STEP ONE ###

Download and install the required tools and libraries

# MSYS (32-bit) from http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS
# Mingw-w64 (32-bit) from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/
# Cygwin from http://cygwin.com/

Cygwin is only used for upx, zip and unzip.  If you don't need those, you can omit it.
A bit of Makefile editing is required to remove the references to these utilities.

# Strawberry Perl (32-bit) from http://strawberryperl.com/
# PAR-Packer from CPAN

Once you have Strawberry Perl installed, go to a windows command prompt and type

cpanp install PAR-Packer

# StormLib (Beta) from http://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/stormlib.html

You can use the 64-bit versions of MSYS, Mingw-w64 and Strawberry Perl if you have
a 64-bit OS.

### STEP TWO ###

Put extract.pl, Makefile, stormlib.diff and mpq.cpp in a directory of your choice,
henceforth "DIRECTORY".

### STEP THREE ###

Unzip stormlib_beta.zip into DIRECTORY, so that it resides in DIRECTORY\StormLib

### STEP FOUR ###

Edit the Makefile to point to the correct program locations.

### STEP FIVE ###

open an MSYS terminal and type the following commands

cd DIRECTORY
make patch
make

### STEP SIX ###

If all goes well, you should have a working set of executables!

Make sure you've put the correct paths in the Makefile and then type

make install
make test
